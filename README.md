Includes 
 - reconstruction of EBSD grains, grain size analysis, calculation of intragranular and mean grain orientations, CPO plots (MTEX/Matlab)
 - calcite twin density paleopiezometry following Rybacki et al., 2013 (R)
 - analysis of carbonaceous material Raman spectra following Kouketsu et al., 2014 (R)
 - rheological modelling using constitutive flow laws for quartz, calcite, chlorite, and illite (R). References included in script.
